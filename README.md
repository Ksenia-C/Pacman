# Pac-Man
Simplified version of Pac-Man. A trying to implemented game in 2019.
C++ and SFML are used here.

There are Pac-Man control, energizers (after eating which Pacman can destroy Ghosts),
most of the original behaviour of Ghosts (they move toward the certain point; move random if Pac-Man has eaten energizer),
house for Ghosts, tunnel, only one level with 3 health points.

There are not many levels (again - only 1), some part of behaviour when ghosts accelerate and change their directions (and as I remember they need move toward Pac-Man),
berries as additional bonuses.

Little bugs can appear but it even makes the game more random.
